## About
   - This is our final project for the [Data Visualization and Analytics] program(https://bootcamp.umn.edu/data/landing%20full/).
   - We used a code template from the online 
course ["Deep Learning Specialization"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) to train the model and use it to generate music.
   - The app is deployed on Heroku: https://mj-music-generation.herokuapp.com/. 

## Goal
   - Using music input, train a model with LSTM recursive neural network,  and generate new pieces of the same style.
   
## Usage
   - From the "The trained pairs" list,  one can compare the original input and the outputs from the trained model obtained   with 100 and 25000 epoches.
   - From the "Upload files" section, you can upload your own mp3 files(size less than 10M and total number<6) and try listening online. More functions of the app(e.g., train the model using an user uploaded mp3 file) are under developing.
