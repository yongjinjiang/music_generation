# music_generation
using music input, train a model with LSTM recursive neural network,  and generate new pieces of same style.

## (some comments)
This is our final project for the "data visualization and analytics" bootcamp at the UofM. We used a template from the online 
course "deep learning specialization" to learn and generate music. The app is deployed on Heroku: https://mj-music-generation.herokuapp.com/. 
From the "The trained pairs" list,  one can compare the original input and the output from the trained model with 100 and 25000 epoches.
From the "Upload files" section, you can upload your own mp3 files(size less than 10M and total number<6) and try listening online. Some more functions are still under developing.
